# Company_Challenge


Company A is a data and marketing technology business that unlocks value for businesses using insight to reach the mobile audience in Africa. The utilization of mobile
marketing has kept on developing over all channels (offline and online). 

At Company A we analyze behavioral, transactional, and demographic data to segment customers with similar attributes. The segments help create more personalized messages
that could potentially increase conversion rate. Our Machine learning algorithms can forecast the likelihood that customers will purchase, install, unsubscribe, sign up
or confirm a loan by finding patterns. By more intelligently analyzing the intricacies and customer journeys of previous customers, companies can better understand how
they acquired leads and customers in the past, and who didnâ€™t convert in the end.

Task A: In mobile marketing, conversion rate (CVR) is a metric that measures the number of conversions advertisers receive on their ads per number of clicks. Company A
is sharing data from previous campaigns for you to develop models predicting ad CVR for an ad campaign related to downloading or installing an application. Given a user,
what is the probability that he (or she) will install or download an app? 

You will be given a training and validation dataset for this task. 
The outcome of this task should be a dataframe (the msisdn is a unique identifier), probability (likelihood of converting), result (whether a user will convert or not).
Default threshold was set to 0.50 in this sample file. Use any threshold you deem fit for this task

Task B: In this project, you have been provided with extensive sample data of the general population on Company A database and established users who have
installed/downloaded an app in order to create customer segments. The data includes demographic and transaction records of customers. Company A AdOps (Advertising
Operations) team would like to leverage ML to launch a targeted marketing ad campaign that is tailored to a specific group of customers. In order for this campaign to be
successful, Company A has to divide its customers into distinctive groups. This process is known as "customer segmentation" and it is crucial for maximizing marketing
campaign conversion rate. 
Build segments to identify potential customers that will download or install an app
